# Informatics-Project-1
This is my Informatics Project One that i did as part of my Univeristy Project.
It entails a web based ecommerce pharmacy with prescription verification.
In order to purchase Prescription only Medicine one must upload a valid prescription and provide the hospital/clinic email from which the prescription was obtained.
The hospital will receive an email asking to verify the uploaded prescription before it can be processed for the order.
The project was developed using HTML, CSS, BOOTSRAP, PHP, JQUERY, AJAX and MYSQL Database.
